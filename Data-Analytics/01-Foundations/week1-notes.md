# Learning Log

### Consider how data analysts approach tasks:

#### Reflect on the case study from earlier

- The analysts **asked** questions to define both the issue to be solved and what would equal a successful result.
- Next, they **prepared** by building a timeline and collecting data with employee surveys, which should be inclusive.
- They **processed** the data by cleaning it to make sure it was complete, correct, relevant, and free of errors and outliers.
- They **analyzed** the clean employee survery data. Then the analysts **shared** their findings and recommendations with team leaders. Afterward, leadership **acted** on the results and focused on improving key areas.

#### Reflection response: write 2-3 sentences (40-60 words) in response to each of the questions

1. Did the details of the case study help to change the way you think about data analysis? Why or why not?

   The details of the the case study did help me learned more about using data analysis in more situations. As now I have learned that data analysis is a very powerful tool or skill to gain insights on questions that may or may not be clear at first glance.

2. Did you find anything surprising about the way the data analysts approached their task?

   I am surprised that the data analysts would need to come up with the right approach to the survey in order to make a valid analyze to the problem. During the process, the analysts also find a relation between the long or short hiring process that would become a factor that effected the employee retention.

3. What else would you like to learn about data analysis?

   I would like to learn more about the **prepared** and **processed** steps about data analysis. It is interesting to see the methods that can be use in the data collection, also cleaning or searching through the mass amount of data in order to find relation about the data and the question.
