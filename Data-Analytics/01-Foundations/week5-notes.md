# Reflect on the data analysis process so far

- Which part(s) of the data analysis process did you enjoy the most? What did you enjoy about it?

  I would say I enjoy the Ask process the most, because you could all way come up with question to address the problem on hand, but it is hard to come up with question to something that seens to be working. So when I learn the 5 whys, it how me understand more about a better way to address the problem or goal.

- What were some of the key ideas you learned in this course?

  The key ideas I learned in this course are data analysis process, stages of the data life cycle, analytical skills, analytical thinking, data-driven decision making and many different terms use in the field. Also, the use of spreadsheet to catch the data to perform some analysis and visualization, and the use of SQL for large amount of data.

- Are there concepts or portions of the content that you would like to learn more about? If so, what are they? Which upcoming course do you think would teach you the most about this area?

  I would like to learn more about how to analysis the data, because there are a lot of indormation or data being produce every minute, it is hard to tell which is useful or not. So I am looking forward to the course where we learn to prepare the data.

- Now that you've gained experience doing data analysis, how do you feel about becoming a data analyst? Have you feelings changed since you began this course? If so, how?

  I feel that I just begin to touch on the tip of the icebreg so far, there is so much more mass below the water. I would say I am really interest to see what I find out in the upcoming courses and to see if I can become a data analyst.
