# Key Terms

### Structured thinking - The process of recognizing the current problem or situation, organizing available information, revealing gaps and opportunities, and identifying the options.

## Six Common Problem Types and Approach

1. **Making predictions** - Using data to make an informed decision about how things may be in the future
2. **Categorizing things** - Assigning information to different groups or clusters based on common features
3. **Spotting something unusual** - Identifying data that is different from the norm
4. **Identifying themes** - Grouping categorized information into broader concepts
5. **Discovering connections** - Finding similar challenges faced by different entities and combining data and insights to address them
6. **Finding patterns** - Using historical data to understand whant happened in the past and is therefore likely to happen again

## SMART Question - is the effective way of asking question

- **Specific** - simple, significant questions that focused on a single topic or a few closely related ideas
- **Measureable** - questions that can be quantified and assessed
- **Action-oriented** - questions that encourage change
- **Relevant** - questions that matters, important, and have significance to the problem you're trying to solve
- **Time-bound** - questions that are specify the time to be studied

# Reflection

### What data means to you?

As people are being brought together by technology, information and resources, people start to record what happened, I think this is the beginning of data. Data is just a record of information, events, numbers, and even thoughts. It can be use to identify a issue or problem, then help solve it. It can also be use to classify difference or similarities. The most important of all, data can be use to gain insight or advantage on the subject matter.

### When you come across a problem and you aren't sure of the answer or solution, what do you do?

When I come across a problem, I would first look around to find similarities or past reference to the problem, if there is any. If there was a similar problem I have faced in the past, I would use the solution as a reference to guide me through solving the current problem. Otherwise, if the problem is completely new, I then would try to find the root cause of the problem by gathering data or information and try to find connections within the data in order to solve the problem.

### How do you identify new and interesting problems to begin with? Is there a process you use to identify problems you want to solve?

The method I like to use to identify new and interesting problems is by looking around, searching the web, and also asking myself to see if I come up with an answer to the problem. I really enjoy the process of hearing or reading a problem, then I go search for the explaination of the problem in depth, if there is. After, solving the problem on my own or look at other's solution whom solved the problem before me, in order to gain an insight.
