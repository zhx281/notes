## Data collection considerations

- ### How the data will be collected
  Decide if you will collect the data using your own resources or receive and possibly purchase it.
- ### Choose data sources
  - **First-party data** - Data collected by an individual or group using their own resources
  - **Second-party data** - Data collected by a group directly from its audience and then sold
  - **Third-party data** - Data collected from outside sources who did not collect it directly
- ### Decide what data to use
- ### How much data to collect
  - **Population** - All possible data values in a certain dataset
  - **Sample** - A part of a population that is representative of the population
- ### Select the right data type
- ### Determine the time frame
  Decide how long you will need to collect it.

### Discrete data - Data that is counted and has a limited number of values

### Continuous data - Data that is measured and can have almost any numeric value

### Nominal data - A type of qualitative data that is categorized without a set order

### Ordinal data - A type of qualitative data with a set order or scale

### Internal data - Data that lives within a company's own systems

### External data - Data that lives and is generated outside of an organization

### Structured data - Data organized in a certain format such as rows and columns

### Unstructured data - Data that is not organized in any easily identifiable manner

### Data model - A model that is used for organizing data elements and how they relate to one another

### Data elements - Pieces of information, such as people's name, account numbers, and addresses

## Levels of data modeling

1. Conceptual data modeling - gives a high-level view of the data structure, such as how data interacts across an organization.
2. Logical data modeling - focuses on the technical details of a database such as relationships, attributes, and entities.
3. Physical data modeling - depicts how a database operates, it defines all entities and attributes used.

### Relationship Diagram (ERD) - A visual way to understand the relationship between entities in the data model

### Unified Modeling Language (UML) - Very detailed diagrams that describe the structure of a system by showing the system's entities, attributes, operations, and their relationship.

### Data type - A specific kind of data attribute that tells what kind of value that data is

### Text or string data type - A sequence of characters and punctuation that contains textual information

### Boolean data type - A data type with only two possible values, such as TRUE or FALSE

### Row as a **Record**, column as a **Field**

### Wide data - Data in which every data subject has a single row with multiple columns to hold the values of various attributes of the subject

### Long data - Data in which each row is one time point per subject, so each subject will have data in multiple rows

---

### Data transformation - the process of changing the data's format, structure, or values.

**Data transformation usually involves**

- Adding, copying or replicating data
- Deleting fields or records
- Standardizing the names of variables
- Renaming, moving, or combining columns in a database
- Joining one set of data with another
- Saving a file in a different format

**Goals for data transformation**

- Data **organization** - better organized data is easier to use
- Data **compatibility** - different applications or systems can then use the same data
- Data **migration** - data with matching formats can be moved from one system to another
- Data **merging** - data with the same organization can be merged together
- Data **enhancement** - data can be displayed with more detailed fields
- Data **comparison** - apples-to-apples comparisons of the data can then be made
