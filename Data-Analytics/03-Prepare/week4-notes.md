### Data Security - Protecting data from unauthorized access or corruption by adopting safety measures

### Encryption - uses a unique algorithm to alter data and make it unusable by users and applications that don't know the algorithm

### Tokenization - replaces the data elements you want to protect with randomly generated data referred to as a "token", and the original data is stored in a separate location and mapped to the tokens.
