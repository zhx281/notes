# Key Terms

### Data integrity - The accuracy, completeness, consistency, and trustworthiness of data throughout its lifecycle

---

## Threats to data integrity:

### Data replication - The process of storing data in multiple locations

### Data transfer - The process of copying data from a storage device to memory, or from one computer to another

### Data manipulation - The process of changing data to make it more organized and easier to read

### Other threats:

    - Human error
    - Viruses
    - Malware
    - Hacking
    - System failures

## Well-aligned objectives and data:

- **Clean data + alignment to business objective = accurate conclusions** : When there is clean data and good alignment, you can get accurate insights and make conclusions the data supports.
- **Alignment to business objective + additional data cleaning = accurate conclusions** : If there is good alignment but the data needs to be cleaned, clean the data before you perform your analysis.
- **Alignment to business objective + newly discovered variables + constraints = accurate conclusions** : If the data only partially aligns with an objective, think about how you could modify the objective, or use data constraints to make sure that the subset of data better aligns with the business objective.

## Types of insufficient data:

- Data from only one source
- Data that keeps updating - data is incomplete
- Outdated data
- Geographically-limited data - could be unreliable

## Ways to address insufficient data:

- Identify trends with the available data
- Wait for more data if time allows
- Talk with stakeholders and adjust your objective
- Look for a new dataset

### Population - All possible data values in a certain dataset

### Sample size - A part of a population that is representative of the popluation

    - Don't use a sample size less than 30.
    - **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)**
    - The confidence level most commonly used is 95%, but 90% can work in some cases
    - Use a larger sample size:
      - for a higher confidence level
      - to decrease the margin error
      - for greater statistical significance

### Sampling bias - A sample isn't representative of the popluation as a whole

### Random sampling - A way of selecting a sample from a population so that every possible type of the sample has an equal chance of being chosen

### Calculating sample size:

- **Margin of error** : Since a sample is used to represent a population, the sample's result are expected to differ from what the result would have been if you had surveyed the entire population. This difference is called the margin error. The smaller the margin error, the closer the results of the sample are to what the result would have been if you had surveyed the entire poplulation.
- **Confidence level** : How confident you are in the survey result. Confidence level is targeted before you start your study because it will affect how big your margin of error is at the end of your study
- **Confidence interval** : The range of possible values that the popluation's result would be at the confidence level of the study. This range is the sample result +/- the margin of error
- **Statistical significance** : The determination of whether your result could be due to random chance or not. The greater the significance, the less due to chance.

### Statistical power - The probability of getting meaningful results form a test

    - Statistical power of 0.8 or 80% is typically considered the minimum for statistical significance
    - Usually, you need a statistical power of at least 0.8 or 80% to consider your results statistically significant

### Hypothesis testing - A way to see if a survey or experiment has meaningful results

## Sample size calculator:

- Confidence level: The probability that your sample size accurately reflects the greater population.
- Margin error: The maximum amount that the sample results are expected to differ from those of the actual population.
- Population: This is the total number you hope to pull your sample from.
- Sample: A part of a population that is representative of the population.
- **Estimated reponse rate**: If you are running a survey of individuals, this is the percentage of people you expect will complete your survey out of those who received the survey.

### Margin of error: The maximum amount that the sample results are expected to differ from those of the actual population

### **To calculate margin of error you need:**

    - Population size
    - Sample size
    - Confidence level
