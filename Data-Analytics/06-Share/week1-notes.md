# Key Terms

### Data visualization - The graphic representation and presentation of data

1. Looking at visuals in order to understand and draw conclusions about data
2. Creating visuals using raw data to tell a story

### Scientists and mathematicians began to truly embrace the idea of arranging data visually in the 1700s and 1800s

### Quick rule for creating a visualizaiton:

- Visual should be clear and easy to follow. Ex: Your audience should know exactly what they're looking at within first five seconds of seeing it.
- Understand the conclusion your draw. Ex: After the first five second, your audience should understand the conclusion your draw, even if they aren't totally familier with the research you've been doing.
- Always welcome feedback to adjust your visualization and go back to the data to da further analysis.

### What Makes a Good Visualization: (David McCandless)

- Information (data) - the data you are working with
- Story (concept) - a clear and compelling narrative or concept
- Goal (function) - a specific objective or function for the visual
- Visual form (metaphor) - an effective use of metaphor or visual expression

### Junk Charts Trifecta Checkup: (Kaiser Fung)

- What is the practical question?
- What does the data say?
- What does the visual say?

### Bar graphs - Use size contrast to compare two or more values

- Start y-axis at zero to aviod misleading

### Line graphs - Help your audience understand shifts or changes in your data

### Pie charts - Show how much each part of something makes up the whole

### Maps - Help organize data geographically

## One of your biggest considerations when creating a data visualization is where you'd like your audience to focus

### Histogram - A chart that shows how often data values fall into certain ranges

### Correlation charts - Show relationships among data

### Causation - Occurs when an action directly leads to an outcome

### Static visualizations - Do not change over time unless they're edited

### Dynamic visualizations - Visualizations that are interactive or change over time

### Tableau - A Business intelligence and analytics platform that helps people see, understand, and make decisions with data

### Heatmap - Similar to bar charts, mainly used to show relationship between two variables and use a system of color-coding to represent different values.

### Distribution graph - display the spread of various outcomes in dataset

### Meaningful patterns:

- Change: This is a trend or instance of observations that becomes different over time. A great way to measure change in data is through a line or column chart
- Clustering: A collection of data points with similar or differnt values. This is best represented through a distrubution graph.
- Relativity: These are observations considered in relation or in proportion to something else. Probably seen examples of relativity data in pie charts.
- Ranking: This is a position in a scale of achievement or status. Data taht requires ranking is best represented by a column chart.
- Correlation: This shows a mutual relationship or connection between two or more things. A scatterplot is an excellent way to represent this type of data pattern.

### Decision tree - A decision-making tool that allows you to make decisions based on key questions

### The elements of art:

- Line: Add visual form
- Shape: always in 2 dimentional, 3 dimemtional shape be can easily confusing
- Color:
- Space
- Movement - flow or movement of the values

### Principle of design:

- **Balance** : When key visual elements, like color and shape, are distributed evenly. This means your visualization shouldn't have one side distracting from the other.
- **Emphasis** : Having a focal point for the audience to know where to concentrate.
- **Movement** : Path the viewer's eye travels or literal movement created by animations. Movement in data visualization should keep to a minimum, and mimic the way people usually read.
- **Pattern** : Using similar shapes and colors. This can be useful to highlight similarities or to break up between different data sets.
- **Repetition** : Repeating chart types, shapes, or colors adds to the effectiveness of your visualization.
- **Proportion** : Demonstrate the importance of certain data.
- **Rhythm** : Creating a sense of movement or flow in your visualization.
- **Variety** : Keeps the audience engaged by using some variety in the chart types, lines, shape, colors, and values.
- **Unity** : The final data visualization should be cohesive. If the visual is disjointed or not well organized, it will be confusing and overwhelming.

### Data composition - Combining the individual parts in a visualization and displaying them together as whole

### Elements for effective visuals:

1. Clear meaning - clearly communicating insights
2. Sophisticated use of contrast - separating the most important data form the rest
3. Refined execution - deep attention to detail

### Design thinking - A process used to solve complex problems in a user-centric way

### Five phases of the design process:

- **Empathize** : Thinking about the emotions and needs of the target audience for the data visualization
- **Define** : Figruing out exactly what your audience needs from the data
- **Ideate** : Generating ideas for data visualization
- **Prototype** : Putting visualizations together for testing and feedback
- **Test** : Showing prototype visualizations to people before stakeholders see them

### Headline - A line of words printed in large letters at the top of the visualization to communicate what data is being presented

### Subtitle - Supports the headline by adding more context and description

### Label - Identifies data in relation to other data

### Annotation - Briefly explains data or helps focus the audience on a particular aspect of the data

### Legend - Idenfifies the meaning of various elements in a data visualization

### Ways to make data visualization accessible:

- Labeling
- Text alternatives: Alternative text provides a textual alterantive to non-text content
- Text-based format
- Distinguishing
- Simplify
