# Key Terms

### Tableau - A business intelligence and analytics platform that helps people see, understand, and make decisions with data.

- Tableau enables you to observe and understand data to make decisions, connect to data in databases, spreadsheets, or CSV files, and create and share interactive dashboards with data.
- Tableau offers browser-based and desktop versions. Browser-based solutions are preferred by companies adopting cloud-based services while desktop solutions might be suitable for companies maintaining services on their private networks.
- Tableau Public's Gallery features data visualization examples created by you and users across the web.

### Dynamic visualizations - Visualizations that are interactive or change over time

## Primary chart types in spreadsheets

- **Column (vertical bar)**: a column chart allows you to display and compare multiple categories of data by their values.

- **Line**: a line chart showcases trends in your data over a period of time.

- **Pie**: a pie chart is an easy way to visualize what proportion of the whole each data point represents.

- **Horizontal bar**: a bar chart functions similarly to a column chart, but is flipped horizontally

- **Area**: area charts allows you to track changes in value across multiple categories of data.

- **Scatter**: scatterplots are typically used to display trends in numeric data.

- **Combo**: combo charts use multiple visual markers like columns and lines to showcase different aspects of the data in one visualization.

## Example of visualization specialized in Tableau

- **Highlight tables**: appear like tables with conditional formatting.

- **Heat maps**: show intensity or concentrations in the data.

- **Density maps**: show concentrations (like population density map).

- **Gantt charts**: show the duration of events or activities on a timeline.

- **Symbol maps**: display a mark over a given longitude and latitude.

- **Filled maps**: maps with areas colored based on a measurement or dimension.

- **Circle views**: show comparative strength in data.

- **Box plots**: also known as **box and whiskers charts** show the distribution of values along a chart axis.

- **Bullet graphs**: compare a primary measure with another and can be used instead of dial gauge charts.

- **Packed bubble charts**: display data in clustered circles.

### Tableau data type representations:

- **#**: Numeric data
- **Abc**: String data
- **Globe (icon)**: Geographic data
- **Calendar (icon)**: Date data
- **Calendar with a clock (icon)**: Date and time data

### Diverging color paletter - Display two ranges of values using color intensity to show the magnitude of the number and the actual color to show which range the number is from

### A lot of people associate green with positive results and red with negative results.

### You could make the visualization more effective by reducing the number of labels per country and using only one font. Doing this makes the labels easier to read.
