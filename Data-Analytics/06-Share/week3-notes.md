### Dashboard - A tool that organizes information from multiple datasets into one central location for tracking, analysis, and simple visualization through tables, charts and graphs

### Dashboard filter - A tool for showing only the data that meets a specific criteria while hiding the rest

### Data storytelling - Communicating the meaning of a dataset with visuals and a narrative that are customized for each particular audience

### 3 data storytelling steps:

1. Engage your audience

   - **Engagement** : Capturing and holding someone's interest and attention
   - When audience is engaged, they are more likely to connect and be convince
   - Identify your audience
   - Understand what internal stakeholders want from the project
   - Seek to capture the audience's attention on an intellectual and emotional level

2. Create compelling visuals

   - show the story of your data
   - Visuals should take your audience on a journey of how the data changed over time or highlight the meaning behind the number
   - Visuals should be clear and able to stand on their own
   - Incorporate some interactive layered data so the curious can explore
   - Highlight the meaning behind the numbers at a glance

3. Tell the story in an interesting narrative

   - A narrative has begining, middle and end.
   - It should connect the data you've collected to the project objective and clearly explain important insights from your analysis.
   - Data storytelling should be organized and concise.
   - Choose a primary message/spotlight
   - Clearly articulate recurring themes and data points
   - Provide recommendations at the end.
   - Tips on the narrative:
     - **Character**: the people affected, could be your stakeholder, customer, clients, and others
     - **Setting**: which describes what's going on, how often it's happending, what task is involved, and other background information about the data project that describes the current situation.
     - **Plot**: sometime the conflict, is what creates tension in the current situation.
     - **Big reveal**: or resolution, is how the data has shown that can solve the problem
     - **Aha moment**: is when you share your recommendations and explain why you think it will help

### Word clouds - A simple way to visualization words that were presented in your data. It uses different sizes base on how often the word appear in your data set.

### Speaking to your audience

- Knowing your audience:

  - What role does this audience play?
  - What is their stake in the project?
  - What do they hope to get from the data insights?

- Once knowning the answers to those question:

  **Choose your primary message**

- Every parts of your story need to flows from this key point, so it's got to be direct and clear.

- Big part of being a data analyst is knowing how to eliminate the less important details.

- **Spotlighting**: pinpoint the most relevant data derived from their analysis and eliminate the less important details. Spotlighting involves scanning the data to quickly identify the most important insights. This can be done with notes on a whiteboard, by searching for broad ideas, and by identifying concepts that arise repeatedly.

### Option in Tableau layout:

- **Vertical** layout adjusts the height
- **Horizontal** layout resizes the width of the views and objects it contains
- Evenly distributing the items within your layout helps create a clear and organized data visual.
- **Tiled items** are part of a single-layer grid that automatically resizes based on the overall dashboard size
- **Floating items** can be layered over other objects

### Filters in Tableau can be used to limit information, customize information, or highlight a data point.

- You might choose to use filters in order to highlight individual data points or to zero in on what's important to your stakeholders.

### To customize a chart in a spreadsheet, you can change the colors, data, and type of chart.

### Themes make slideshows more consistent and professional by controlling color, font types and sizes, and positioning of text and visuals.

## Live Versus Static

### **Static data** - involves providing screenshots or snapshots in presentation or building dashboards using snapshots of data.

| Can tightly control a point-in-time narrative of the data and insight     | Insight immediately begins to lose value and continues to do so the longer the data remains in a static state |
| Allows for complex analysis to be explained in-depth to a larger audience | Snapshots can't keep up with the pace of data change                                                          |

### **Live data** - means that you can build dashboard, reports, and views connected to automatically updated data.

| Dashboards can be built to be more dynamic and scalable                                                                           | Can take engineering resources to keep pipelines live and scalable, which may be outside the scope of some companies' data resource allocation                                 |
| Gives the most up-to-date data to the people who need it at the time when they need it                                            | Without the ability to interpret data, you can lost control of the narrative, which can cause data chaos (i.e. teams coming to conflicting conclusions based on the same data) |
| Allows for up-to-date curated views into data with the ability to build a scalable "single source of truth" for various use cases | Can potentially cause a lack of trust if the data isn't handled properly                                                                                                       |
| Allows for immediate action to be taken on data that changes frequently                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Alleviates time/resource spent on process for every analysis                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                                |
