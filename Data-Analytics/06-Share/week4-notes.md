# Key Terms

## Presenting with a framework:

- The purpose of a framework is to create logical connections that tie back to the business task.
- It also gives your audience context about your data and helps you focus on the most important information.
- The framework of your presentation starts with your understanding of the business task
- By showcasing what business metrics you used, you can help your audience understand the impact your findings will have
- Establishing the hypothesis early in the presentation will help your audience understand the data
- Present the possible business impact of the solution and clear actions stakeholders can take

### Hypothesis - The theory you're trying to prove or disprove with data

## The McCandless Method:

1. Introduce the graphic by name
2. Answer obvious questions before they're asked
3. State the insight of your graphic
4. Call out data to support that insight
5. Tell your audience why it matters

### Colleague test - helps you assess what questions your stakeholders might have, what assumptions they might make, and what areas of your presentation might be unclear.

## Preparing for the Q&A:

- **Before the presentation**

  1. Assemble and prepare your questions.
  2. Discuss your presentation with your manager, other analysts, or other friendly contacts in your organization.
  3. Ask a manager or other analysts what sort of questions were normally asked by your specific audience in the past.
  4. Seek comments, feedback, and questions on the deck or the document of your analysis.
  5. At least 24 hours ahead of the presentation, try and brainstorm tricky questions or unclear parts you may come across, this helps avoid surprises.
  6. It never hurts to practice what you will be presenting, to account for any missing information or simply to calm your nerves.

- **During the presentation**
  1. Be prepared to respond to the things that you find and effectively and accurately explain your findings.
  2. Address potential questions that may come up.
  3. Avoid having a single question derail a presentation and propose following-up offline.
  4. Put supplementary visualizations and content in the appendix to help answer questions.

### Types of objections

- **About the data**
  - Where you got the data?
  - What systems it came from?
  - What transformations happened to it?
  - How fresh and accurate is the data?
- **About your analysis**
  - Is your analysis reproducible?
  - Who did you get feedback from?
- **About your findings**
  - Do these findings exist in previous time periods?
  - Did you control for the differences in your data?

### Responding to possible objections:

- Communicate any assumptions
- Explain why your analysis might be different than expected
- Acknowledge that those objections are valid and take steps to investigate further
- If your stakeholder has a concern about a problem you didn't realize, you can acknowledge the objection and promise to take steps to investigate further.

### Q&A best practices:

- Listen to the whole question
- Repeat the question (if necessary)
- Understand the context
- Involve the whole audience
- Keep your responses short and to the point
